     *   Called when a <i>text</i> artifact is found.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *   A sequence of chars is considered to be <i>text</i> when no structures of any kind are
     *   contained inside it. In markup parsers, for example, this means no tags (a.k.a. <i>elements</i>),
     *   DOCTYPE's, processing instructions, etc. are contained in the sequence.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *   Text sequences might include any number of new line and/or control characters.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     *   Text artifacts are reported using the document <tt>buffer</tt> directly, and this buffer
     *   should not be considered to be immutable, so reported texts should be copied if they need
     *   to be stored (either by copying <tt>len</tt> chars from the buffer <tt>char[]</tt> starting
     *   in <tt>offset</tt> or by creating a <tt>String</tt> from it using the same specification).
     * </p>

     * @param offset the offset (position in buffer) where the text artifact starts.
     * @param len the length (in chars) of the text artifact, starting in offset.
     * @param line the line in the original document where this text artifact starts.
     * @param col the column in the original document where this text artifact starts.
     * @throws ParseException if any exceptions occur during handling.
