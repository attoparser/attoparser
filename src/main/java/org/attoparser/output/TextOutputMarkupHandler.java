/**
 * <p>
 *   Implementation of {@link org.attoparser.IMarkupHandler} used for writing received parsing events as text output,
 *   by ignoring all events except the <em>Text</em> ones. This means this handler will effectively strip all
 *   markup tags (and other structures like comments, CDATA, etc.) away.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Note that, as with most handlers, this class is <strong>not thread-safe</strong>. Also, instances of this class
 *   should not be reused across parsing operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Sample usage:
 * </p>
 * <pre><code>
 *   final Writer writer = new StringWriter();
 *   final IMarkupHandler handler = new TextOutputMarkupHandler(writer);
 *   parser.parse(document, handler);
 *   return writer.toString();
 * </code></pre>
