         <h2>Contributing to attoparser: Terms</h2>
    
         <p>
           In order to contribute to attoparser, there are some terms you must agree with:
         </p>
    
         <h3>Who can contribute?</h3>
      
         <p>
           Anyone, with the unique condition that he/she must be a <b>private individual</b>,
           acting in his/her own name, and not being endorsed in their contributed work
           by any company or government.
         </p>
         <p>
           Note that this condition will not only refer to the ownership of the effort invested in contributing
           to the project, but also to the fact that no private or public company will be mentioned
           as a a part of your contribution on the project's website or code, including but not limited
           to email addresses or package names.
         </p>
         
         <h3>About your contributed code</h3>
    
         <ul>
           <li>
             First and important: your code <b>must both compile and work correctly</b>. 
             Also, the addition of any new patches to the codebase should not render 
             it unstable in any way.
           </li>
           <li>
             There should be no compilation warnings.
           </li>
           <li>
             All your code should follow the Java Code Conventions. The only 
             exception to this is that column limit is not the usual 
             80 characters (this is a matter of convenience -just don't make them 200 characters
             long and it will be OK).
           </li>
           <li>
             Remember that indentation is made of four spaces, not tabs.
           </li>
           <li>
             All your code should compile and run in Java 1.5, and it should be 
             easy to read and understand by a human.
           </li>
           <li>
             All public methods and classes directly available to the attoparser users
             should have comprehensive javadoc (e.g: functions, operators), and 
             code should have a reasonable amount of comments in it (when needed, 
             of course, not just comment for the sake of comment).
           </li>
           <li>
             All comments, names of classes and variables, log messages, etc. must
            be in <b>English</b>.
           </li>
         </ul>
    
         <h3>About your relation to the attoparser project</h3>
    
         <ul>
           <li>
             First and most important: please, don't feel any obligation to do 
             anything. If you like/want/feel happy about contributing, go for it. If not, 
             don't feel any kind of commitment just for having discussed technical 
             details with the project maintainers or other members, just leave it 
             behind and it will be absolutely fine, 
             even if it is after months and you have already coded thousands of lines.
           </li>
           <li>
             You will be <kbd>@author</kbd> for any new classes that you code and also 
             co-author to any existing classes to which you make <i>significant</i> 
             changes. Of course you can say "no" to this, but unless you do, it 
             is a matter of basic fairness to give the credit and merit to the person 
             who deserves it.
           </li>
           <li>
             Your contributions will be applied as patches that you will send to the
             project maintainers, and you will have the consideration of <i>contributor</i> 
             in the team page. This means that you will not have read+write direct access to
             the git repository. This is something reserved for developers
             who are author to a very significant percent of the total code base. Of 
             course, this consideration can change in the future.
           </li>
           <li>
             And importantly: You will have to take the required measures, under your 
             entire responsibility, to <b>ensure that neither you nor the company/ies you work for will 
             ever claim any rights over your contributed code</b>, and that all the code 
             you contribute is original and will rise no claims over its intellectual 
             property by any third persons or companies. Also, you agree to contribute 
             your code or documentation <b>completely for free and under the terms established by the 
             Apache License 2.0 in a time-unlimited basis</b>.
           </li>
         </ul>
         
    
    
         <h3>Contributing to attoparser: Steps</h3>
    
         <p>
           If, after carefully reading the above terms, you are willing to contribute 
           some of your effort to attoparser, first of all... THANK YOU!
         </p>
         <p>
           The steps you should take are:
         </p> 
    
         <ol>
           <li>
             First, send an email to the project maintainers talking about the new features
             or fixes you would like to contribute.
           </li>
           <li>
             If your contribution is approved, send the project maintainers an email
             including a copy of the terms above, with your complete name, and 
             stating clearly that you agree with these conditions.
           </li>
           <li>
             If you work for a company which, by the way or place in which your code was
             written, by your contract terms or by the laws in your country, could claim
             any rights (including but not limited to intellectual or industrial property) over your contributed code, you will have
             to send the project maintainers (either by email from your authorised superiors or 
             by signed fax), a statement indicating that your company agrees
             with the terms explained in this page, and that it both authorises your 
             contribution to attoparser and states that will never claim any kind of rights 
             over it.
           </li>
         </ol>
